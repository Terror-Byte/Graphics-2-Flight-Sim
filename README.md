# Graphics-2-Flight-Sim
This project is a "flight simulator" made with C++ and OpenGL as part of the Graphics 2 module during the 2nd year of my degree. 

In the "flight simulator", the player takes control of a spaceship and flies around the level shooting targets. The aim of this project was to challenge students to implement a piece of software that not only loads in and renders models, but adds a layer of interactivity turning the program into a rudimentary game. Students were tasked with loading in and rendering 3D models (such as the terrain, the "player", and other parts of the world), loading and rendering a skybox, programming various rendering shaders, and adding interactive elements to the "game".

The skeleton of an OpenGL program was provided for students to build their "flight simulator" in. Students were allowed to use external libraries (such as in my case, GLM) to help with certain operations. The GLM library was used in this project to perform complex mathematical operations.

## How to use
The project unfortunately does not build in current versions of visual studio. If the project becomes buildable again, instructions for use will be provided here.
